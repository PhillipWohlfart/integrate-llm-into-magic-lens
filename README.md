# Combining Magic Lenses with Large Language Models for Text Corpus Exploration
This tool was developed as part of my bachelor thesis. \
The full code will be uploaded here after the thesis is finished at the end of October

## Tool Description
This tool aims to facilitate the exploration of the contents of various scientific articles related to the visualization field using a large language model.
Its main functionality is to summarize selected articles in concise form and return their most salient facts. Furthermore, the tool allows the quick comparison of a selected set of articles. For these language processing functions the latest version of GPT-4o-mini is integrated into the application.

The tool employs a “magic lens” which is used to investigate a set of data points in a view. Each data point represents an abstract of a visualization article published at IEEE VIS from 1990-2023. The proximity between points on the screen relates to a calculated similarity of the abstract texts. This results in a clusterization of the abstracts.
You can use your mouse to drag the magic lens over the points and get insights about the abstracts behind it. The lens size can be changed by a slider.
The different visualizations and “AI functionalities” can be changed in the options.
